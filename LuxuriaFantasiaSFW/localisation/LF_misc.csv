LFCourt600T;Fear started to creep in...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCourt600;My lord, some idiot from the Kingdom of Portugal claiming to be the wind has pinned a letter to the front gates!\n\n------------------\nFear because this ragtag developer built a brand on its own and out of nothing, fear because of its networking abilities were enabling it to find and coordinate talents worldwide, fear because Universo Virtual was delivering milestone after milestone at a meagre price, fear because UV was able to raise the interest of the community while having absolutely nothing to show for almost a year, fear for the nearly unmatched popularity of the dev diaries of Magna Mundi, fear because this upstart company was in effect acting like a producer not a developer, fear for UV’s assertive behaviour when calling Paradox on past promises, fear because out of a slight intended to hurt the capabilities of the team this amateur developer was able to force Paradox hand in surrendering a better renderer, fear because in the only instance Magna Mundi was shown to the mainstream strategy press with any kind of popularity rating, it got to second place out of more than 11000 titles for a day, was in sixth place for a few more days and in fourteenth for about a week, marks that surpassed Paradox flagship titles by far (regarding that batch of previews, best result for Sengoku was 113th, best result for Crusader Kings 2 was 42nd). Fear also for the way it seemed to sense danger and tricks and other low blows. Fear for the unpredictability of its actions or way of thinking no matter the tricks employed to monitor it. Fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LFMisc3T;Luxuria Fantasia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFMisc3;Welcome to Luxuria Fantasia!\n\n  If you are seeing this message, everything has been installed correctly.\n  If you are seeing this message twice, it's because you are a Ruler Designer character and Paradox hasn't gotten off their butts and fixed the problem where your ruler and the ruler that you replaced are considered the player on the first day.\n\n  Luxuria Fantasia was not specifically made for multiplayer. It can certainly work in multiplayer games, but there may be oddities. Your mileage may vary. Please report all problems in the LL forum thread or the House Irae discord server.\n\n  The Options Menu wlll pop up in one day, and the Racial Choice events will pop up a day later. You will be able to choose to customize the Custom Religion from the intrigue menu after you choose a race (or remain human).\n\n  There are no racial seeding options outside of Random/Shattered Worlds, but AI rulers will occasionally adopt exotic races from time to time.\n\n  Thank you for playing, and have fun <3\n-Kekvit Irae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
