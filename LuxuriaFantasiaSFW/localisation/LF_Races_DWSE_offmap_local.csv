dwseom500;As you approach the festival grounds you begin to see the shapes of many dragons dancing in the sky and among the trees surrounding the area.\n As You approach you notice these drakes are not dancing, but mating! You take note that many of the dragon mates are not other dragons but appear to be humanoid. \n A dragon approaches you, he seems alone. He stares at you with hunger in his eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwseom500A;Discard your clothes and join him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwseom500B;Quickly turn and leave before you do something you will regret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwseom501;You awaken in a stupor lying in your bed. You do not remember returning here. The last you remember is your dalliance with a young drake at the festival.\n Suddenly a fire shoots through you. IT BURNS! IT BURNS! Is all you can think as you roll in pain. "Make it stop" You quietly beg.\n The burning increases it is as if the Sun itself is inside you! You must push it out.\n Moments, maybe hours later you lie on your bed exhausted, the fire has receded and left you with a pleasant feeling of completeness.\n As you rise from your bed you notice a molten egg upon your bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwseom501A;"I will care for you my child" you whisper to the warm egg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwseom700;Before you sits a dragon, old and wise. He has come to collect your egg and take it deep into the Elder Forest so it may hatch and grow among its own kind.\n The drake states that ultimately it is your choice, but it would be best for him to take the egg. He states that any dragon raised on this side would lack the might and prowess of its kin from the Forest. No more than an intelligent beast he states. Strong compared to beasts of this world but quiet lacking to what it could be.\n A Dragon of the forest however would have the greatest mind, mighty wings in which to fly the in the skies of the world and strength to shatter even the tallest mountains. Something it would shorely lack here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwseom700A;Give him the egg and allow your child to grow up in the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwseom700B;Keep the egg, you are its mother. Your child will grow up here with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
dwseom800;As you hold your egg in your arms you begin to wonder what kind of creature will you be? Will you be kind? Will you be cruel? Will you be strong or will you be smart? Will you be both?\n Is the world ready for you? Are you ready for the world? Questions upon questions pass through your mind. As the questions pile up in your mind a single through stands at the forefront of your mind: Is it time?\n Time to let your little one open their eyes? Time to let them take to the skies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwseom800A;It is time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwseom800B;The world is not ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwseom801;Seasons have passed since you decided to bring your little one into the world. You placed your egg carefully in the fireplace months ago and the maids have tended it around the clock. Not once have the flames gone out. But still the egg has not moved. You wish to see your child's shining eyes but know you must wait.\n A shout Echos the hall, a maid rushes up to you. She tells you how the egg has begun to rock and crack.\n A moment is all it takes for the words to register in your mind, before you rush off to your bedroom and look into the fireplace. Indeed the egg is rocking and shows a few cracks.\n A moment passes before a scaley head pokes out of the shell and looks at you in wonder.\n You pick up the young drake as you climb from the fireplace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
