LF_Orc10T;Orcs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LF_Orc10;Descended from the same fae bloodline as elves and fairies, orcs have gone down a different evolution path from their fae cousins. Rather than being lithe and agile like the elves, or tiny and magical like the fairies, orcs are a strong and hardy race, able to survive in nearly any environment with little to no discomfort.\n\nOrcish culture revolves around war. Only the strongest of orcs survive to adulthood, and only the strongest of the strong are fit to lead. However, there are instances where orcs eschew their violent nature and embrace magic. While not as magically-inclined as fairies, orc warlocks are no less powerful. Despite orcish culture being mostly tribal and nomadic, their capacity for intelligence is as good as a human's, and some have even risen to be great war tacticians.\n\nOrcs are defined by their tusks, muscular bodies, and green skin (though instances of brown-skinned orcs have been recorded). Despite being less muscular than men, orcish women are every much as strong as men, and often are the true rulers of the household. Men and women together take up arms in war. This gender equality owes itself to the orcish culture of strength and determination. An orcish woman has equal say in matters of law and politics, so long as they can prove themselves in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
