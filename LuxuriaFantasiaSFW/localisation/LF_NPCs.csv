LFNPCAshaTitle;Luxuria - Asha the Dancer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFNPCAsha;It's high time for a night out on the town. The local tavern is hosting a troupe of dancers from foreign lands, and I would be remiss if I didn't at least turn up to the show. As I enter, I am greated by the troupe manager, whom ushers me to a chair by a makeshift platform. She explains that her dancing troupe is traveling the land looking for patronage.\n\n The show starts and I am presented with the sight of a woman of dark skin going by the name of Asha. Asha's movement is very fluid, and I can quickly see that her quality is well above the other dancers. I verify my assessment that she's of Egyptian heritage with the manager. Apparently Asha took to a life of adventure early in life that didn't go so well, spent time on a pirate ship, and then found herself passing through our lands when she heard of the desire for exotic dancers. \n\n I watch as Asha never stops moving. Whether it's her shoulders rolling, or her hips swaying, her body keeps you entranced. And while the crowd grows excited, it's obvious that she enjoys the attention as well. \n\n The manager breaks my gaze as she inquires if I'd like to be the troupe's patron. She also hints that Asha might be interested in settling down, if I were bold enough to ask.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LFNPCCharlotteTitle;Luxuria - Charlotte The Bard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFNPCCharlotte;Word has reached me of a new bard playing in the local tavern. I have time to kill, so I figure an hour or two listening to the newcomer will fill the time until I need to sleep.\n\n As I arrive, it's clear that the bard- a woman with flaming red hair- almost seems to be more fantasy than reality as she takes the small stage in Bordello. Charlotte is her name.\n\n  While a beauty like hers typically makes it hard to look anywhere else, something about her commands me to meet her gaze. When I do, her eyes seem to only be looking at me. Her full lips then begin a song, softly, quietly. As though demanding that everyone quiets down to hear her. \n\n  The effect works as all eyes are on her. As the song continues her voice gets stronger. Her body accentuates the song and I feel almost as though she's a snake charmer as her performance is bewitching. \n\n  It's a few moments where her lips slowly curve into a smile that we realize that the song has ended and the room breaks into heart felt applause. The tavernkeep mentions that she will be leaving in a few days, as she is looking for a home to settle down to. Perhaps I can offer her permanent patronage?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LFNPCLenoraTitle;Luxuria - Lenora The Gypsy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFNPCLenora;Tonight, I am hosting a feast for foreign diplomats and nobles. My guests hail from around Eastern Europe. Most claim to be nobles with bloodline ties to the ruling families there. My Chancellor wasn't familiar with them, but it doesn't really matter. Just spreading my name and word of my good graces across the world is good enough for me. One guest, however, strikes me as odd. A strikingly-beautiful woman dressed in the garb of the gypsies that inhabit the old wagon outside. It's clear she is no noble, but the other guests either treat her with deep respect or give her a wide berth.\n\n  We introduce ourselves, and I find her name is Lenora, a skilled magic user in her own right. While she doesn't do the usual tarot or scrying of the local gypsies, she is grateful to the respect I have given to her 'sisters' (as she calls them). \n\n  Lenora mentions that she is looking for a place to settle down and live, preferably in a land with like-minded sisters. All she asks for is a small sum of money to pay for her own wagon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LFNPCLynness;As I retire to my bed for the night, I am greeted by an intruder in my bedchambers. I see a being that is otherworldly in her beauty. She's casually playing with her hair as she waits. Upon seeing me, she gives an inviting smile and I feel my pulse quicken. \n  As I get closer, I blink my eyes in surprise. The woman appears to be a succubus, with a set of wings that protrude from her back. A dangerous approach, to be seen as she is. \n\n  "I am Lynness, a child of [GetLilithName]," she speaks softly. Her words are enchanting, and I feel compelled to listen. "I hear that you are looking for a new lover." I begin to protest, but Lynness puts her finger to her lips to silence me. "The nights are so lonely, and I have many, many ways of curing that." Her body is so ravishing that I cant help but stare as she speaks. "As for payment, all I require is a simple kiss." \n\n  Lynness leans into my body, and I feel a part of my soul is gone, as is the willpower to resist her advances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LFNPCYingLi;Tonight I am hosting a feast for diplomats of the Far East. One such diplomat is a beautiful, young woman. After finally having time to myself, I take the opportunity to introduce myself. "I am Ying Li," she speaks with a graceful bow. "I am an exile of my lands. Once, I was a daughter of a powerful nobleman in [GetChinaDynasty] of China, but my father wanted to sell me off like some whore to disgusting old man." \n\n  I offer her a glass of wine while she speaks, but Ying Li politely declines. "I left my home and my country and started to travel the land under a new name. In my travels, I've picked up quite a bit of martial experience from the various bandit raids my caravan suffered from. I am seeking a new home to settle down in." I inquire about her price to stay, and she notes that she only requires a pittance of gold to buy a house and perhaps start a new business.\n\n It's clear that this woman is highly educated, and she would make a great asset to my court. Ying Li is expecting an answer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LFNPCMwambaTitle;Luxuria - Mwamba the Warrior;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFNPCMwamba;Tonight I am hosting a party for some distinguished guests from Western Africa, diplomats who bring with them a man with a fierce gaze. This man, Mwamba, apparently comes from a tribe that lost a territory battle. He's apparently the son of the Chief that lost, and has agreed to a life in exile in return for his mother and sister being spared. The diplomats are responsible for seeing Mwamba through to his final place of exile. In order to ensure his word is kept. \n  Mwamba also appears to be very honor bound, and by reimbursing the diplomats travel expenses, it will place the burden of repayment upon Mwamba. Ensuring that he remains as his debt is paid off. \n  While intrigued, I wish to confirm what was said and find that Mwamba, while not happy about his situation, has sworn to abide by it fully as long as his mother and sister are safe. I do inquire as to what guarantees he'll have that they are safe, and I learn that a messenger will visit him annually with such proof. \n  In terms of a risky deal, this one isn't so bad. And he brings the kind of exotic flavor and warrior skills that could benefit me. So after a little consideration, I make my decision. His glare almost pierces my soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LFNPCDesmonaTitle;Luxuria - Desmona the Vampire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFNPCDesmona;I'm outside enjoying the cool evening air when I suddenly feel that I'm no longer alone. I turn, scanning the area for the interloper and find an enchanting elven woman, scantily clad in the cool evening air. Her eyes are piercing, and I feel as though she is looking through me and taking measure of who I am, and her skin is as pale as the moonlight itself. It is clear that she is no ordinary elf, but one of the risen dead.\n\n  "You are [Root.GetFullName]? I am Desmona, an adventurer. I've come in search of you this evening for I have a request of you, what with you being the ruler of these lands."\n\n  I learn several things from Desmona. Her desire to meet with me was to seek a temporary domicile while she hides from hunters. She wouldn't elaborate much on her situation. She's also very self confident, caring little for how others view her attire.\n\n  Her demeanor is pleasant, although I sense that she seeks an answer from me as to whether I'll accept her remaining here for a period of time. I get the feeling there is clearly more to her, and I'm not certain if her presence will be a boon or a bane. I suppose I need to at least provide her an answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LFNPCBrielleTitle;Luxuria - Brielle Dragon-Scale;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFNPCBrielle;While doing some of your regular duties as [Root.GetTitle], one of your courtiers approaches you with an urgent message. They explain that a rather interestingly dressed woman has approached the castle, and that she wishes to have an audience with you.\n\n  Upon meeting her, you can immediately notice her rather scandalous attire and her almost staggering beauty. While your Court Bishop looks away out of disgust, the woman then decides to speak up. Hello, [Root.GetTitledName]! My name is Brielle Dragon-Scale, and I have heard of you in my many travels, and you also happen to be the closest landed noble nearby so, how about gaining a skilled northern duelist for yourself? \n\n  That was quite blunt. Not many would work up the courage to just go ahead and directly ask a [Root.GetLordLady] for employment. She smiles at you warmly, and seems generally quite harmless. It isnt out of this world for adventurers to sometimes swear themselves to a particular liege, looking for a salary or at least some manner of protection, but this so far has to be the strangest adventurer youve ever seen.\n\n  I have fought many beasts and tribes in Svjbold, and I have determined that my abilities would be best used by someone who knows how to utilize them. All I ask is for a bit of protection and direction. She is clearly the type of adventurer who is quite aimless in goals and ambitions, but could be used very effectively by someone who knows how to make her abilities useful.\n\n  And, should you desire, I could do a bit of proving myself towards you. Its unclear whether she means giving a combat demonstration, or doing something way more befitting of what shes wearing.\n\n\n\nCustom character created by SubscribeStar subscriber Venom Max;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LFNPCMeeshka;Just as you are settling down for the night, there comes a knock at your bedchamber's door. Why is it that you always have guests when you are about to go to sleep, and why is it always some random girl or guy that you are expected to make a decision to keep or banish? Nevermind the fact that they always somehow make it past your guards unnoticed. It's like the mod author ran out of ideas when writing this shit.\n  Mentally rolling your eyes, you open your door and expect to find some half-naked girl standing there. Standing before you is, indeed, a half-naked girl, dressed only in a cloak. Well shit, your instincts were right on the money. Tomorrow you will need to buy a lottery ticket or something with the way your luck has been going. What is surprising, however, is that she's only four feet tall. And looks more like a teenager than a woman. Before you nope the fuck out and go back to bed, the mod author assures you that she is of legal age.\n  "Meeshka!" she proudly exclaims, striking a happy pose that does little to hide the fact that SHE IS WEARING NOTHING BUT A FUCKING CLOAK. "Meeshka happy Mommy sent me to live with you!" You rub your temples in annoyance and ask who this 'Mommy' is. "Mommy is Mommy! Big, pointy ears, red eyes, dark skin, sometimes beats Meeshka for stealing from the cookie jar. Mommy Uh Ray!" Again you rub your temples in annoyance. Irae. Nothing good can come out of keeping this child-like girl, but to turn her away might anger the Matron. Like it or not, you're being railroaded into another of these decisions.\n  Just as you are about to answer, Meeshka's eyes light up as she sees the dwarven loincloth on display on a nearby wall. She rushes over and snatches it. "Yay! You found my mask!" the girl bounces happily as she ties the loincloth around her face in a makeshift mask. "Mommy used to let me play with this lots! I love Mommy!" You decide not to tell her that the loincloth has been graced and soiled by a thousand generations of dwarven groins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
