LF_Elf10;Descended from the same fae bloodline as orcs and fairies, elves have gone down a different evolution path from their fae cousins. At first glance, one would mistake an elf for an exceedingly beautiful human... until they see the pointed ears. Lithe and agile, elves can glide through the forest with as much ease as a monkey can move through the jungle.\n\nElves are distinguished solely by their pointed ears and their age.\n\nElves, to the short-lived humans, seem to be immortal. This is simply not the case, however. While the lifespan of an elf can exceed that of a human by a factor of ten, death by old age is not uncommon. The only reason elves have not spread themselves to the furthest corners of the globe is that elven women are naturally infertile. Maidens have a harder time of becoming pregnant, and this infertility increases the more children they have. This has led many elves to embrace a culture where sex is not taboo.\n\nRumors persist about dark-skinned elves living underground, though these rumors are often laughed at by the greater elven community as just mindless drivel.\n\n\nElven Mechanics:\nImmortality - Elves, once they reach adulthood, will never age, though they can die from other means.\nInfertility - Women start with a malus to their fertility, which increases the more they have children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
