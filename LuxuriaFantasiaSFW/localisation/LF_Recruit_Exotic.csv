lf_recruitment1;Luxuria - Exotic Race Adoption;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFRecruit1;You have chosen to adopt one of the exotic races living (or hiding) in the world. Send out an emissary to speak with an orphanage and see if you can adopt one of these mythical beings into your family. \n\n Heaven or Hell allows you to adopt a Divine or a Demon. Divines hate Demons, and vice versa.\n\n Far East allows you to adopt Kitsunes and Nekos.\n\n Fae allows you to adopt Elves, Orcs, and Fairies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LFRecruit2;Divines are mortal servants of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].\n\n Succubi are the daughters of the (supposedly) evil [GetLilithName]. Incubi are the lesser-known sons of [GetLilithName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lf_recruitment3;Luxuria - Far East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFRecruit3;Kitsunes are the famed fox demons of the Far East. Though they may technically be demons, they have no relation to the forces of Hell. The number of tails they sport (up to nine) is representative of how old and powerful they are. \n\n Nekos are the feline counterparts to Kitsunes. Unlike Kitsunes, they only have one tail, have almost no inherent power, and are fairly lazy to say the least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lf_recruitment4;Luxuria - Fae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFRecruit4;Elves could easily pass off as humans if it wasn't for their pointed ears and natural affinity for magic and long life. Inherently proud, Elves choose to live a life of seclusion away from contact with other races. \n\n Orcs are green-skinned brutes who enjoy conflict. Often mistaken for ogres or other similar monsters, Orcs are often hunted down by humans out of fear. Unlike the other mythical races, however, Orcs actively encourage this conflict, as they live for war. \n\n Fairies are the most elusive and secluded of all the mythical races, choosing only to reveal themselves to humans when threatened or when feeling playful. They do not boast the Elven longevity, nor the Orcish resilience, and thus Fairies are a rare breed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
