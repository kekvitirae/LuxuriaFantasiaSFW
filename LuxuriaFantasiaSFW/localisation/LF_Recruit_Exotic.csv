lf_recruitment1;Luxuria - Exotic Race Recruitment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFRecruit1;You have chosen to recruit one of the exotic races living (or hiding) in the world. Send out an emissary to recruit one of these mythical beings to your court. \n\n Heaven or Hell allows you to recruit an Angel or a Succubus/Incubus. Angels hate Demons and lustful/hedonist characters, and Demons hate Angels and chaste/celibate characters. If you are one of these, you will not be able to recruit the other. \n\n Far East allows you to recruit Kitsunes and Nekos. Kitsunes hate Tentacle-kin, and you will not be able to recruit them if you are one. Nekos hate werewolves. \n\n Fae allows you to recruit Elves, Orcs, and Fairies. Elves and Orcs hate each other, and you will not be able to recruit the other if you are one of them. Fairies have no preference.\n\nYou will NOT be able to recruit a race if you do not have the appropriate module installed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LFRecruit2;Angels are divine servants of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]. They will only join one whose heart is pure. \n\n Alu-fiends are the granddaughters of the (supposedly) evil Lilith, and will only join those who enjoy a good time in bed. Cambions are the lesser-known grandsons of Lilith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lf_recruitment3;Luxuria - Far East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFRecruit3;Kitsunes are the famed fox demons of the Far East. Though they may technically be demons, they have no relation to the forces of Hell. The number of tails they sport (up to nine) is representative of how old and powerful they are. \n\n Nekos are the feline counterparts to Kitsunes. Unlike Kitsunes, they only have one tail, have almost no inherent power, and are fairly lazy to say the least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LFRecruit3B;Recruit a Neko;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lf_recruitment4;Luxuria - Fae;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFRecruit4;Elves could easily pass off as humans if it wasn't for their pointed ears and natural affinity for magic and long life. Inherently proud, Elves choose to live a life of seclusion away from contact with other races. \n\n Orcs are green-skinned brutes who enjoy war and slaving. Often mistaken for ogres or other similar monsters, Orcs are often hunted down by humans out of fear. Unlike the other mythical races, however, Orcs actively encourage this conflict, as they live for war. \n\n Fairies are the most elusive and secluded of all the mythical races, choosing only to reveal themselves to humans when threatened or when feeling playful. They do not boast the Elven longevity, nor the Orcish resilience, and thus Fairies are a rare breed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LFBeefcake12;  I had sent out an emissary to recruit one of the divines that roam the land. Imagine my surprise when nothing short of divinity walked into my throne room.\n  The man was shirtless, sporting chisled muscles that only an Elysian god could produce and feathered wings that towered over his six-foot body. He was nothing less than perfection in my eyes. I had to take my gaze off of his chest for just a moment to examine him further, when I noticed that he was sporting quite a large tool inside his tight trousers. All the courtiers who gathered couldn't believe their eyes either.\n  He moved closer to me, and I was helpless to prevent his hand from cupping my cheek, intoxicated on his musky scent. "I am Kasbeil," he spoke softly into my ear. "I am the divine messenger of love, and I would want for nothing else than to serve you..." Kasbeil leaned in closer, the way two lovers would. I could feel his hot breath on my ear as he continued, "...in any capacity you desire.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFBeefcake12T;Luxuria - Kasbeil, the Divine Lover;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFBeefcake13;  I had sent out an emissary to recruit one of the demons that roam the land. Imagine my surprise when nothing short of divinity walked into my throne room.\n  The man was shirtless, sporting chisled muscles that only an Elysian god could produce and leathery wings that towered over his six-foot body. He was nothing less than perfection in my eyes. I had to take my gaze off of his chest for just a moment to examine him further, when I noticed that he was sporting quite a large tool inside his tight trousers. All the courtiers who gathered couldn't believe their eyes either.\n  He moved closer to me, and I was helpless to prevent his hand from cupping my cheek, intoxicated on his musky scent. "I am Therzon," he spoke softly into my ear. "I am the demon prince of hedonism, and you... are my new ward." Therzon took my hand into his and drew it up to his face, gently kissing each fingertip. "Command me," he whispered, looking me straight in the eyes, "either in the field of battle... or in the bedroom.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFBeefcake13T;Luxuria - Therzon, the Demon Hedonist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFBeefcake14;  I had sent out an emissary to recruit one of the fox demons that roam the land. Imagine my surprise when nothing short of divinity walked into my throne room.\n  The man was shirtless, sporting chisled muscles that only an Elysian god could produce and a trio of white fox tails that accentuated his six-foot body. He was nothing less than perfection in my eyes. I had to take my gaze off of his chest for just a moment to examine him further, when I noticed that he was sporting quite a large tool inside his tight trousers. All the courtiers who gathered couldn't believe their eyes either.\n  He moved closer to me, and I was helpless to prevent his hand from cupping my cheek, intoxicated on his musky scent. "I am Oda Noriharu," he spoke softly into my ear in a strange foreign accent. "I am known as a mystic of my lands, and I would want for nothing else than to serve you..." Oda leaned in closer, the way two lovers would. I could feel his hot breath on my ear as he continued, "...in any capacity you desire.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFBeefcake14T;Luxuria - Oda Noriharu, the Kitsune Mystic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFBeefcake15;  I had sent out an emissary to recruit one of the cat people that roam the land. Imagine my surprise when nothing short of divinity walked into my throne room.\n  The man was tall for a neko, roughly six-feet in height, and a long brown tail- not unlike that of a cat. The grace of his movements as he danced from one end of the room to my throne... he was nothing less than perfection in my eyes. I had to take my gaze off of his lithe form for just a moment to examine him further, when I noticed that he was sporting quite a large tool inside his tight trousers. All the courtiers who gathered couldn't believe their eyes either.\n  He moved closer to me, and I was helpless to prevent his hand from cupping my cheek, intoxicated on his musky scent. "I am Liu Chao," he spoke softly into my ear in a strange foreign accent. "I am one of the last heirs of the Liu dynasty of China, and until I reclaim my rightful place again I would want for nothing else than to serve you..." Chao leaned in closer, the way two lovers would. I could feel his hot breath on my ear as he continued, "...in any capacity you desire.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFBeefcake15T;Luxuria - Liu Chao, the Neko Heir;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFBeefcake16;  I had sent out an emissary to recruit one of the elves that roam the land. Imagine my surprise when nothing short of divinity walked into my throne room.\n  The man was shirtless, sporting chisled muscles that only an Elysian god could produce and long, pointed ears that accentuated his six-foot body. He was nothing less than perfection in my eyes. I had to take my gaze off of his chest for just a moment to examine him further, when I noticed that he was sporting quite a large tool inside his tight trousers. All the courtiers who gathered couldn't believe their eyes either.\n  He moved closer to me, and I was helpless to prevent his hand from cupping my cheek, intoxicated on his musky scent. "My name is Lockesly L'Crit," he spoke softly into my ear. "I am a traveling bard, and I would want for nothing more than to sing of your glory." Lockesly took my hand into his and drew it up to his face, gently kissing each fingertip. "Should you command it, I will shout your name," he whispered, looking me straight in the eyes, "either in court... or in the bedroom.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFBeefcake16T;Luxuria - Lockesly L'Crit, the Elven Bard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFBeefcake17;  I had sent out an emissary to recruit one of the orcs that roam the land. Imagine my surprise when nothing short of divinity walked into my throne room.\n  The man was shirtless, sporting chisled muscles that only an Elysian god could produce and long tusks that accentuated his six-foot body. He was nothing less than perfection in my eyes. I had to take my gaze off of his chest for just a moment to examine him further, when I noticed that he was sporting quite a large tool inside his tight trousers. All the courtiers who gathered couldn't believe their eyes either.\n  He moved closer to me, and I was helpless to prevent his hand from cupping my cheek, intoxicated on his musky scent. "Varguk," he spoke in a rough, yet commanding, manner. "Warleader." A man of few words he is, but his body and attitude more than makes up for his lack of speech. "I am your guard..." he shouted, an intimidation tactic to ward off the other courtiers, but soon his voice drifted low as he continued, "...or mate.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFBeefcake17T;Luxuria - Varguk, the Orcish Warleader;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFBeefcake18;  I had sent out an emissary to recruit one of the fairies that roam the land. Imagine my surprise when nothing short of divinity walked into my throne room.\n  The man was completely nude, sporting chisled muscles that only an Elysian god could produce and large fae wings that accentuated his six-foot body. He was nothing less than perfection in my eyes. I had to take my gaze off of his chest for just a moment to examine him further, when I noticed that he was sporting quite a large tool... fully erect and waiting. All the courtiers who gathered couldn't believe their eyes either.\n  He moved closer to me, and I was helpless to prevent his hand from cupping my cheek, intoxicated on his musky scent. "I am Silverlead," he spoke in a soft voice. "I am a prince to my people, but I would want nothing more than to be your prince." He drew closer to me, as lovers would, and I could feel his shaft poking my body. "Command me.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
