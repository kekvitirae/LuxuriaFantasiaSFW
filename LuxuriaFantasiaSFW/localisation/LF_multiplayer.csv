LFMultiplayer1;Demons are the progeny of Lilith, the first woman created by God. Males are cambions and females are alu-fiends, the half-blooded grandchildren of Lilith. They have the ability later in life to become full-blooded demons through the Chosen of Lilith society.\nThe Divine are the mortal instruments of their deity. Be they peaceful messengers or wrathful weapons of war, that is up to the divine itself.\nKitsune are fox spirits (or demons) hailing from the Far East. They are notable having a human body with fox ears and tails, as well as their affinity for magic.\nNekos hail from either Ancient Egypt or the Far East. Similar to kitsune, they sport cat ears and a cat tail.\nElves are the long-lived, pointy-eared relatives of the fae. Though mostly sticking to forests, some elves have a wanderlust so strong that they have integrated into human society.\nOrcs are the distant cousins of elves. Notable for their green skin and tusks, orcs live for one thing... war. A weak orc is a dead orc.\nFairies are the closest relatives to the original fae. Growing, at most, a foot tall and sporting butterfly-like wings, some fairies use their magic to grow to human size and hide their wings to integrate into human society.\nHalf-dragons are born from a (often forced) union of a dragon and a human. They sport the body of their human parent with the scales and horns of their draconic parent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
