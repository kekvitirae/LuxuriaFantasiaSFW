LFCoreGypsy1T;Luxuria - The Gypsy Wagon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreGypsy1;As you approach the wagon, you notice a woman sitting out in front, dressed in colorful traditional Romani clothes. She smiles at you and beckons you closer.\n\n"Well met, my [Root.GetLordLady]. No doubt thou hast heard of my residence. I have been waiting for a virtuous [Root.GetManWoman] such as thee." Her speech is a little odd, but she does not give off any hint of deception or hostility. "I can tell thine personality and possibly future. All thou dost need is to answer seven questions of mine."\n\nThe woman continues before I have a chance to speak, "I must warn thee, however. Once thee answers the questions, the change on thee is permanent. Thou can only walk one path, so choose wisely and with conviction."\n\n The woman grins with a wink. "And fear not, my [Root.GetLordLady], there will be no questions about sweetrolls.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LFVirtueChosen;Luxuria - Path Chosen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreGypsy31TTB;I feel like a world of sin has washed away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreGypsy31TT;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCompassionChosen;"Ah," the woman nods contemplatively, "thou hast chosen the path of the Bard, as marked by thy devotion to Compassion."\n\nThe gypsy smiles and waves her hand. "Compassion is the primary virtue of Love. It is the non-judgmental empathy for thine fellow creatures. The quality of empathy, of recognizing and sharing the feelings of others."\n\n"He who lives without Compassion dies Loveless. Compassion is the child's awe at the natural world and their love for all who live in it. Compassion for others reflects the Love in thy soul. It requires strength to hold Compassion, for under duress, it is quick to flee. In testing thy will to aid others, Compassion shall grow in your spirit like a wildfire.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFSacrificeChosen;"Ah," the woman nods contemplatively, "thou hast chosen the path of the Tinker, as marked by thy devotion to Sacrifice."\n\nThe gypsy smiles and waves her hand. "Sacrifice is the combination of both Love and Courage. It is the Courage to give of thyself in the name of Love. It is the placing of the interests of others and the ends of virtue over thine own well-being."\n\n"Sacrifice gathers Love in the palm of Courage. Sacrifice requires a Love of thyself to be given without consideration to others when that selfish Love suggests safer choices. Where there is no choice, therein lies no sacrifice. Where the shape of thy choices blur and lose definition, the highest standards of the common good find expression. In finding the Courage to share your Love, thou shalt find therein Sacrifice.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFValorChosen;"Ah," the woman nods contemplatively, "thou hast chosen the path of the Fighter, as marked by thy devotion to Valor."\n\nThe gypsy smiles and waves her hand. "Valor is the primary virtue of Courage. It is the courage to take actions in support of thy convictions."\n\n"Valor is the cloak that protects the other seven virtues. Valor gathers selfish Courage and shares it with the beliefs that one holds and protects. Valor is tested again and again, and through it, thee sees the portal to virtue. To demand Valor of thyself is to lead the way for others to find it in their hearts.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFJusticeChosen;"Ah," the woman nods contemplatively, "thou hast chosen the path of the Druid, as marked by thy devotion to Justice."\n\nThe gypsy smiles and waves her hand. "Justice is the combination of both Love and Truth. It is the devotion to Truth, tempered by Love. It is the wisdom that perceives what is right and what is wrong in human action."\n\n"Wherein Truth and Courage are reconciles lie the secrets of Justice. It bears no moderation, for it doth not shine in the fog of war. The fiery will that spurs thee towards Justice can lose sight of the Truth. To judge with a level eye demands Truth and Courage of conviction to pursue the Truth. In reward, Justice shall give temperament to thy spirit.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFHonestyChosen;"Ah," the woman nods contemplatively, "thou hast chosen the path of the Mage, as marked by thy devotion to Honesty."\n\nThe gypsy smiles and waves her hand. "Honesty is the primary virtue of Truth. It is scrupulous respect for Truth- the willingness never to deceive thyself or another. The pursuit of Truthfulness, with respect to thyself and with respect to other beings."\n\n"To thyself, be true. Honesty begins with the will to regard the Truth in thy heart. A true heart spreads its warmth to the home and across the entire world. In seeing the world in true form, thou can draw upon the magic that connects all living things: the power of the ether. To thy self, be true. In repetition and experience, thou shalt find Honesty whose comeliness inflicts shame upon evil.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFHonorChosen;"Ah," the woman nods contemplatively, "thou hast chosen the path of the Paladin, as marked by thy devotion to Honor."\n\nThe gypsy smiles and waves her hand. "Honor is the combination of both Truth and Courage. It is the courage to stand for the Truth, against any odds. It is the Courage to stand for Truth regardless of the circumstances."\n\n"Truth is the tree from whose top sing the bird of Honor. The Courage to be true in repetition brings the song of Honor to thy spirit. Though its melody sweetens over time, Honor can be lost in a moment's hesitation. Honor sings from a lonely mountain. In finding the Courage to pursue the Truths in thy life, thou shall find Honor.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFSpiritualityChosen;"Ah," the woman nods contemplatively, "thou hast chosen the path of the Ranger, as marked by thy devotion to Spirituality."\n\nThe gypsy smiles and waves her hand. "Spirituality is the combination of Truth, Love, and Courage. It is the concern with thy inner being and how thee deals with Truth, Love, and Courage. It is also the awareness of the love that unites thine own inner being to those around thee."\n\n"Spirituality is the urge towards steady improvement of the soul. The spiritual are never sated in thy hunger for Truth, Love, and Courage. From whatever place the Three Principles are viewed, Spirituality rights thee into proper balance. In the unity of Truth, Love, and Courage, thou shalt infuse thy spirit with peaceful Spirituality.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFHumilityChosen;"Ah," the woman nods contemplatively, "thou hast chosen the path of the Shepherd, as marked by thy devotion to Humility."\n\nThe gypsy smiles and waves her hand. "Humility is an odd one, that. It is the opposite of Pride, and independent of the Three Principles of Virtue. Humility is about perceiving thy place in the world, not according to thine own accomplishments, but according to the intrinsic value of all individuals. It is the recognition of the worthiness of all beings, and the perception of thine own place among them, regardless of thy own personal accomplishments or mistakes in the world."\n\n"On the road to Virtue, Humility is an elusive wind in thy face. To lack Truth, Love, and Courage is to spread the seeds of Pride. Humility is that gentle breeze which, upon seeing the seeds of Pride, sweeps away these begetters of hubris and discontent. Humility is often the last Virtue captured, for Pride is quick to flourish. To find Humility, thou must bear witness to the Pride in thy spirit. Only after such an examination, can thou call forth the winds of Humility.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
