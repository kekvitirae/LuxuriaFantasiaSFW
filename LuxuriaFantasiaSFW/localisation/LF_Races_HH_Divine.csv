LF_Divine10;The voice has always been there when I listened. Soothing, caring, guiding. I don't know when it was exactly, but as I grew older I realized it was the Word of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] that was coming through to me. \n  There is occasionally periods of friction, as not all believe me at first, yet over time they come to see the light of my convictions. As I grew, I sought not to rule over others, yet circumstance and acceptance seemed to put me in such a place. \n  That's when I realized my becoming a ruler was [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]'s plan for me all along. For who better to spread the light and fight back the darkness that seeks to spread across the land. \n  I accept the burden of being a ruler, as I'm basked in divine glory and warmth. I shall not falter. I shall be the mortal beacon on this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
