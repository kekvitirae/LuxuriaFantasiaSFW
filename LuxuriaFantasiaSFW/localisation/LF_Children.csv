LFCoreChildren1;Dresses and dolls are just so boring. I dream of being the handsome knight rather than the princess in distress. An idea strikes me, and soon I are wearing one of the courtier boys' trousers and shirt. I grab a toy sword and join the other boys in mock sparring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreChildren1TT;These trousers are really comfortable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreChildren1TTB;That wasn't as fun as I might thought...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreChildren2;[From.GetFirstName] has been acting strange lately. She has taken to wearing the clothing of a boy rather than a proper dress, and now she says she wants to be a noble knight when she grows up! She is turning into a real tomboy. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreChildren2TTA;If [From.GetFirstName] wants to act like a boy, so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreChildren2TTB;I'll beat her until she acts proper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreChildren2TTC;I will pray to [Root.GetHighGodName] to save [From.GetFirstName]'s soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreChildren3;[From.GetFirstName] is extremely displeased by me playing around in 'improper' clothes. [From.GetSheHe] burned all my fun clothes and bought me a new set of dresses, under strict orders that I will get beaten if [From.GetSheHe] sees me wearing trousers ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreChildren3TT;*sigh* Back to playing with dolls again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreChildren4;I've always been fascinated with girls. Their hair is so pretty, and their dresses are so elegant. Why cant I be like them? An idea strikes me... and soon I am dressed up in a pretty skirt by a sympsthetic girl. She giggles as I twirl around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreChildren4TT;I feel so pretty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreChildren4TTB;That wasn't as fun as I might thought...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreChildren5;[From.GetFirstName] has been acting strange lately. He has taken to wearing the clothing of a girl rather than a boy, and now he is playing with dolls! He is turning into a real tomgirl. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreChildren5TTA;*pat [From.GetFirstName] on the head*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreChildren5TTB;I'll beat him until he acts proper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreChildren5TTC;I will pray to [Root.GetHighGodName] to save [From.GetFirstName]'s soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFCoreChildren6;[From.GetFirstName] is extremely displeased by me playing around in 'improper' clothes. [From.GetSheHe] burned all my fun dresses and bought me a new set of trousers, under strict orders that I will get beaten if [From.GetSheHe] sees me wearing a skirt ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
