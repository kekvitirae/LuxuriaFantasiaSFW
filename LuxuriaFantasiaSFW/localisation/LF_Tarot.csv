LFTarot1T;LF - The Astrologian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFTarot1;You are swiftly escorted to the tallest room in the tower by one of the apprentices, and soon left alone. Inside is a spacious room that resembles less of an mage study and more of a library. Only a table in front of you is any sign that this room could be used for research. Sitting in a tucked-away corner of the room is a beautiful elven woman, dressed in little more than sleepwear, surrounded by a multitude of cats.\n\n  "I assume you have come to have your future foretold?" the woman asks in a warm voice. She motions toward the empty chair by the table. "Please, sit. I must warn you that there is no escaping fate, and whatever future I foretell is written in stone."\n\n  Her warm smile fades and changes into an almost sinister smirk as a deck of cards levitates before her. "All I ask is a paltry sum of fifty coins.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFTarot1TTA;"Please tell my future.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFTarot1TTB;"Erm... I'll come back later.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LFTarotMoonU;After laying down the coins upon a nearby stack of books, the woman magically shuffles the deck without touching it, and proceeds to lay out the cards upon the table in a hexagonal formation, face down with one card in the middle. She goes into a spiel about my life and personal matters with each card she flips over. Lastly, she flips over the final card...\n\n"Ah! The Moon in the upright position," she casually exclaims. "The Moon in the upright position symbolizes your imagination is taking the best of you. In the dark of the night, you are taking a path that you are unsure of, for there could be danger lurking in its depths. The moon's light can bring you clarity and understanding and you should allow your intuition to guide you through this darkness.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It could represent confusion and unhappiness - you want to make progress, but you are not sure what is the right thing to do. You must deal with your anxiety and fears by overcoming them, for they are like shadows in the dark.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Remember that you hold within you all that you need for your fulfillment - the only thing that you need is courage. For this, you have all reasons to rejoice. To see this card is a message to have faith, for the universe will bless you and bring forth all that you need.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

One has to be prepared to make the necessary changes that might initially seem painful to make the adjustments that will pay off in the end by being able to find your true self again.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

"Death in the upright position is one of the most feared cards in a Tarot Deck, and it is very misunderstood. Many people avoid mentioning this card because it has that much power. Most times, people take the name of the card literally. However, the real meaning within the Death card is one of the most positive in the whole deck. It signals that one major phase in your life is ending, and a new one is going to start. You just need to close one door, so the new one will open. The past needs to be placed behind you, so you can focus your energy on what is ahead of you.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Resisting the change and holding onto the past can limit your future, which can cause you to feel like you are in limbo. You should take some time to assess the ways that you have been approaching changes in your life. You may find you have been halting the changes that you need due to fears of the unknown.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Hanged Man in the upright position," she casually exclaims. "The Hanged Man in the upright position symbolizes a sacrifice that is needed to make in order to progress forward - whether as repentance for past wrongdoings, or a calculated step backward to recalculate his path onward. His upside down state can also symbolize the feeling of those that walk a spiritual path, for they see the world differently. Where there are others that do not understand the need to sacrifice, you see it differently. This is a natural course of action for you as you walk the path alone.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Wheel of Fortune in the upright position," she casually exclaims.

It is something that is subjected to both kings and workers, and that nobody on earth can avoid what is fated. When you have good moments in your life, make sure that you enjoy to the fullest, for what comes up must always go down. The same is true in reverse - when you are in a bad situation, things will eventually become better again.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Like the wheel, our luck and our fate is always in motion, and sometimes we are on the bottom. Be assured that the wheel will turn again, and you will be okay again soon.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
