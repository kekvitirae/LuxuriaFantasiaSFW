1.4 - Holiday Blood Feud Update
23DEC19

THERE WILL BE BLOOD

Due to their inability to peacefully resolve the question of who is the superior fluff, nekos and kitsune are now Blood Feuded with each other.
Added a gamerule to turn on or off the Blood Feud. But it won't matter because whether you turn on or off the racial content, all kitsune are disabled anyway. #Burn #NekoMasterRace
Fae Blood Feud opinion penalties increased to -50 (from -15).
The Blood Feud county conquest CB can now be used within the same realm. Beware having mixed-race vassals.
You can no longer recruit an exotic race if that race is in a Blood Feud with you.
The Kind trait serves as both a restriction and protection from the Blood Feud mechanic. Characters who are Kind publicly forego the Blood Feud, and in turn allows them to recruit opposite exotic races and protects them from the CBs and the imprisonment effect of the CBs. However, it prevents them from using the CBs, and doesn't negate the opinion modifier. The opposite races are still going to hate you. They just wont take action against you. Probably.
The random vampire attack has a chance of being replaced with a random Blood Feud attack if you are of a Blood Feud race. This will be functionally the same as the vampire attack, but Desmona will NOT protect you. She's above petty race wars.
Because they aren't a part of their pureblooded siblings' Blood Feud, half-demons can recruit divines without restriction.
Added a decision to banish all unimportant Blood Feud characters from your court. Only works on courtiers.

Additions:

Added DWR to the dependency block of the .mod file.
Added a new option in the Options Menu to choose which mod (LF or DWR) to prioritize when traits are conflicting (e.g. lf_futa and futa). Exception: Kitsune will never be replaced with DWR's Fox Kin if Tale of Nine Tails is installed.
You will now have a new targeted decision against characters who have acted dishonorably toward you (e.g. blabbermouthing during a plot). This will forgive them, removing the opinion modifier and the imprisonment reason. You cannot forgive someone who is in a Blood Feud with you.
Added an option to the Options Menu to turn on or off NSFW Mode. This is for those who just want to play LF without catching cooties.

Bug Fixes:

Fixed an issue when using the Custom Religion's holy site seeding if you start in Africa.
Fixed a Custom Religion error when starting in the Steppes.
Fixed a genetics error with Divines.
Added more ToNT tails to the redundancy traits list.
Fixed an error with the Far East buildings scripted_triggers.

Fixed the Swirling Potion not correctly checking elven infertility.
Changed the enslavement death icon to the proper graphic.

Increased the number of times a woman needs to get pregnant before they get the Breeder trait. 9 times if not immortal, 18 if immortal.
Lowered the acceptance penalty for the Take Wife decision when the target is not homosexual. Down to -1 from -3.
Banishing a special NPC will now no longer act like they were recruited, in terms of the mean time to get a new one.
Lynness will no longer take an interest in regular humans. She will now only appear if you or a courtier/vassal is a demon, half-demon, or divine.
Charlotte will now give Poets an extra bonus on top of being free.
Charlotte is now French. The horror.
All special NPCs have been given a boost to their main attribute, except for Desmona and Yi Ling who have been given a boost to all attributes.
Added one_tail to the redundancy traits for better ToNT compatibility.
Disabled the Curio Shop building until events and artifacts can be written for it.
Added the Lover and Player overlays to the static portraits.
Random NPC attacks now have a Holy Shit tier, for players with over 100 combat ability. These characters now completely ignore the auto-win mechanic.
The culture conversion event now hides the portraits of characters on the option when choosing to convert everything.
Rebalanced the racial retinues to be less shit.
High Intrigue characters can now cheat during the random NPC attacks.
Removed the DWSE Crown Expansion law.
Mean time to happen for the random NPC attacks increased to 50 years if you have previously beat one. Up from 40.
Half-dragon racial abillity and Major Heal Self will now clear out disease modifiers from generic illnesses.

Modding:

Added the lf_never_turn_spoopy if you want to prevent certain characters from turning into ghosts when they die. Useful for generating temporary rulers you plan on killing off, or to prevent ghosts from popping up when forcing a temple holder out of office.

1.3.9
18DEC19

The Sex Role assignment event will now happen on the same day as the Gender Bender assignment event.

Modding:

Added the lf_always_switch, lf_always_dominant, and lf_always_submissive character modifiers. Characters with one of these modifiers will always be that role during sexytimes. Works for both the partner and the player.

1.3.6
14DEC19

Enhancements:

A dragon pregnancy from the Dragon Festival will now properly impregnate the character, to prevent actions/events that disallow pregnant characters from happening.
Dragon pregnancy reduced to 45 days (down from 3 months).
The Dragon Festival cooldown is increased to 10 years (up from 5 years).
Daughters who become Dragon Ambassadors will no longer be allowed to go to the Elder Forest again. Sorry, girls, it's a one-time deal only.
