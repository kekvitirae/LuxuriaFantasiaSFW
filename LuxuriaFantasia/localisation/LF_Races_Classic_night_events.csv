#Event Descriptions
LFNight4000.0;I return to my chambers after a long day in court. Upon entering I find Desmona, blood dribbling down her chin, where it further drips upon her cleavage. There is blood sprayed all around my room, with no clear source, save a blackened husk that lays not far from her feet.\n  "Looks like someone was hoping to make a meal of you my [Root.GetLordLady]. I thought I picked up an unnatural scent, and I followed it here, where you had a visitor lurking in the shadows. Alas, they weren't expecting me."\n  I choke down urge to heave, and I wonder if it's from the sight of so much blood sprayed about my room or from watching Desmona's smirk as she drinks from a cup that's filled with it.  I lean out of the door, calling for a servant to clean up the mess.\n  Turning back to Desmona, I ask if it's a vampire that she's familiar with, or if this is the sign of something more? With a sigh of relief, she shares that it didn't match the description of one who has been hunting her. It could be a progeny of one, but it wasn't willing to answer her questions. As far as being part of something larger, she's uncertain.\n  I hear the servant gasp behind me as they reach my doorway. Desmona smiles and slips out while I give the servant instructions on what I want cleaned up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFNight4000.1;I return to my chambers after a long day in court. I grumble in annoyance at the lack of light, assuming that my servants are lacking in a simple responsibility of ensuring my chambers are properly lit.\n  I move to light a candle, when I feel a breeze, and the hairs on the back of my neck raise in warning. I turn towards the window, and I see a creature in the shadows. Its skin is sickly grey, with pupiless eyes that seem to reflect the light of the single candle flame that fights on. I feel it's will, demanding that I stay put as I see it emerge from the shadows, it's mouth, opening to display a row of distorted teeth, with hideously enlarged canines. I hear the blood in my body roar to life, and I take an audible breath, only then realizing that I wasn't breathing as it began to step towards me.\n  This creature is obviously a vampire, one which is here for me. I feel my adrenaline snapping whatever power it was using to try and hold me in place. The only question now, is how do I respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFNight4000A;I'm grateful Desmona was here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFNight4000B;I shall fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFNight4000BSilly;IT'S TIME TO D-D-D-D-D-D-D-DUEL!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

LFNight4001.0;We continue to battle, each seeking to finish the other as our strikes just as intensely as before, yet our ability to avoid getting hit is gone.\n  Grappling, we both muster the strength to press on, to land another blow. I try to growl in victory as I feel my strike land successfully, only to find myself gasping for air as my I myself am mortally wounded.\n  We both collapse. I flounder as I seek to somehow address my wound. Only to realize it's futile. I hear an odd crackling sound, and turn to see my opponent's body crumble to the ground. I'm about to die, yet at least I took my enemy out with me. May those I've saved from its clutches bode well upon my final judgement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFNight4001.1;I go to move, and my legs don't appear to get the message as I do little more than stumble. I will my legs to move as I try to catch my balance. The wounds I've taken is taking its toll and just when I think I've recovered, I feel it slam into me, taking me to the ground.\n  I try to roll with the tackle, seeking to get it off of me. I'm unsuccessful as its grip appears to tighten and further limit my struggles.\n  I can smell the rotten stentch of its breath, feel it against the back of my neck. I want to scream, yet my lungs strain to breath. I don't want to die. Not like this.\n  Tears begin to whelm up in my eyes as I burn what strength I've left as I flail to try and get free. As if it senses I'm spent, I feel its teeth as it bites down on me, and my world fades to black.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFNight4001.2;Its movements have become sluggish. I sense an opening and I leap forward to strike. It hisses and seeks to recoil, yet finds its path blocked as it's cornered. I score a successful hit, sinking deep and my opponent's eyes widen in surprise.\n  I don't relent, slamming my weight upon it to keep it pinned as I strike again, and again, and again.\n  I'm breathing hard, and it's difficult to move my arm any longer. It's then that I notice my enemy is limp, held up only by my body pressing against it. I stumble a bit as I step back and straighten up. Immediately, it crumples in a heap upon the ground.\n  With a sigh, I collapse into a chair, calming myself before calling out to a servant. I'm going to need a drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFNight4001.3;My opponent leaps at me, and I barely get out of the way of its inhuman speed as it strikes at me. I lash out myself, striking its exposed side.\n  My opponent howls with rage and we both exchange a flurry of strikes, with none doing any more additional damage than flesh wounds before we once again separate and circle each other. We are both wounded, and it's clear that any further action will end the fight. But who will be victorious?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFNight4001.4;My opponent moves with an unnatural grace as they circle me. I move to put a piece of furniture between us, looking for means of getting in my own strike. They doen't give me the time to evaluate it.\n  With inhuman speed, they dash towards me, moving around the obstacle between us in the blink of an eye. I try to deflect the blow, yet I am unsuccessful as I feel a pain in my gut from the wound. I stagger a bit and lash out, yet my opponent has already moved.\n  Their hideous face seems to grin mockingly at me, as they once again resume circling me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFNight4001.5;We move around, seeking an opening to strike out each other. My opponent darts forward periodically with a probing strike.\n  I take a smaller step, letting the distance between us close just a bit more. It take the bait and lunges and swipes at me again. I lean back just slightly, its strike falling just short of the mark. I then lunge forward myself and strike. I feel the blow hit soundly, and my opponent hisses and leaps back to put distance between us once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFNight4001.6;I go to move, and my legs don't appear to get the message as I do little more than stumble. I will my legs to move as I try to catch my balance.

Not like this.\n  Tears begin to whelm up in my eyes as I burn what strength I've left as I flail to try and get free. Before I slip unconscious, I feel my neck twisting before finally the bone snaps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
