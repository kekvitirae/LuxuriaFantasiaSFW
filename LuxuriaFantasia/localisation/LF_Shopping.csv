LFPotions1T;LF - Potion Shopping;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LFPotions1;The inside of the shop is extremely cluttered, with potions, alembics, and various other alchemic instruments and creations scattered around. Despite the clutter, it's surprisingly ordered, with everything being where it should.\n\nThe resident alchemist is a woman, likely a mage considering her weaving of aetherical energies into her current work, and pays you no mind while she toils away at her project. "If you have any questions, feel free to ask," she speaks, never looking up from her alchemical equipment.\n\nThe shelves on the left wall of the shop are stocked labeled with potions for bodily enhancement, the right wall is stocked and labeled with potions for mental enhancement, and the shelf on the wall behind the counter isn't labeled, but it's clear the potions for sale there are of the more... exotic variety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
